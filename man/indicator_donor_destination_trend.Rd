\title{Donor→Destination: Geographic Focus Trend}
\usage{
indicator_donor_destination_trend(flows, donor_dest_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects},
\code{budgetYear}, and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{donor_dest_df}{(optional) A dataframe of donor–destination pairs to
merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{donor}, \code{DonorDestination_Focus_Trend} (slope).
}
\description{
Evaluates whether a donor's destination concentration (HHI) is increasing or
decreasing over time.
Goal: Captures whether a donor’s portfolio is becoming more or less geographically diversified over time (trend in HHI per year).
}

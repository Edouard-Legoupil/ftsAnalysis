\usage{
indicator_destination_modality_innovation(flows, destinations = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{destinationObjects}, \code{amountUSD}, and \code{method}.}

\item{destinations}{Optional dataframe to merge results with.}

\description{
Calculates the percentage of funding to a destination that is Cash Transfer
Programming (CTP).

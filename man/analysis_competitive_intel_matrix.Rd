\usage{
analysis_competitive_intel_matrix(flows, recipient_name, peers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{Dataframe \code{flows}.}

\item{recipient_name}{Character name of our organization as appears
in destinationObjects.name (type Organization).}

\item{peers}{Optional character vector of peer organization names.
If NULL peers are all other organizations in destinationObjects.}
}
\value{
Tibble with sector-level and aggregated competitive indicators
and a composite Competitive_Position score.
}
\description{
Computes our organization's competitive position across sectors using:
\itemize{
\item Market_share = Our_funding_in_sector / Total_sector_funding
\item Growth_differential = Our_growth - Average_peer_growth
\item Funding_diversity = 1 - HHI(our_funding_sources)
\item Peer_encroachment = sum(peer_growth_in_our_core_sectors)
}
}
\examples{
result <- analysis_competitive_intel_matrix(flows,
               recipient_name = "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees",
                peers = NULL)
print(result$plot)

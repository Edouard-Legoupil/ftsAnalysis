\title{Knowledge Sharing Intensity}
\usage{
indicator_donor_knowledge_sharing_intensity(flows, donors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe containing at least \code{description} and
nested \code{sourceObjects}.}

\item{donors}{(optional) A dataframe with donor names to merge with the
results.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
\item{donor}{Donor organization name.}
\item{Knowledge_Sharing_Intensity}{Proportion of flows mentioning
collaboration/learning/assessment (0–1).}
}
}
\description{
Measures the proportion of flows mentioning collaboration, learning, or
assessment activities in the description.
}
\details{
Goal: Quantifies the degree to which a donor’s funding supports knowledge
sharing, joint assessments, learning events, or coordination activities.

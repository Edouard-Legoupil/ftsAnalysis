\title{Destination-Focused: Funding Volatility Index}
\usage{
indicator_destination_funding_volatility(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe including \code{destinationObjects}, \code{budgetYear},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe with destination names to
merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Funding_Volatility}
(0–1, where 1 = stable).
}
\description{
Calculates volatility in funding for each destination across \code{budgetYear},
using the coefficient of variation (CV) of annual totals.
}
\details{
Goal: Quantifies year-to-year variability in funding amounts for each
destination.

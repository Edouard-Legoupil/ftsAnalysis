\usage{
indicator_recipient_cofunding_rate(flows, recipients = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe containing \code{destinationObjects} and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{recipients}{Optional dataframe of recipient organizations to merge.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{recipient} and \code{Co_Funding_Rate}.
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of flows where a recipient shares funding
with other recipient organizations (not the sole recipient).
}

recipients <- indicator_recipient_cofunding_rate(flows)

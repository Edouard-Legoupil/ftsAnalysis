\title{Destination-Focused: Donor Diversity Index}
\usage{
indicator_destination_donor_diversity(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{destinationObjects}, \code{sourceObjects},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe of destinations to merge
results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Donor_Diversity_Index}.
}
\description{
Calculates how diversified a destination's funding sources are
using the inverse Herfindahl–Hirschman Index across donors.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures how diversified funding sources are (inverse of dependency).
Computed using the inverse Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (1–HHI) across donors.

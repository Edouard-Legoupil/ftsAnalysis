\title{Amount Stability}
\usage{
indicator_recipient_amount_stability(flows, recipients = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe containing \code{destinationObjects}, \code{budgetYear},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{recipients}{Optional dataframe of recipient organizations to merge.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{recipient} and \code{Amount_Stability}.
}
\description{
Measures the stability of annual funding amounts for each recipient as
1 minus the coefficient of variation of annual totals.
}

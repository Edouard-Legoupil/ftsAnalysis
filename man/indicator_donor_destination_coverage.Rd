\title{Donor→Destination: Coverage Index}
\usage{
indicator_donor_destination_coverage(flows, donor_dest_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects}, and
\code{amountUSD}.}

\item{donor_dest_df}{(optional) A dataframe of donor–destination pairs to
merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{donor}, \code{DonorDestination_Coverage_Index}.
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of destinations a donor supports
out of the total destinations in the dataset.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures how many distinct destinations (countries/plans/sectors)
a donor supports compared to the total destinations in the dataset.
}

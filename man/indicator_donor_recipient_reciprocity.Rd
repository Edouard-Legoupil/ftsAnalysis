\usage{
indicator_donor_recipient_reciprocity(
  flows,
  donor_recipient_pairs = NULL,
  donors = NULL,
  recipient_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{donor_recipient_pairs}{(optional) A dataframe of donor–recipient pairs to merge
results with.}

\item{donors}{(optional used if recipient_name is provided ) A dataframe with donor names to merge with the  results.}

\item{recipient_name}{(optional) the name of a specific recipient to filter the results of the function}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{donor}, \code{recipient},
and \code{DonorRecipient_Reciprocity_Ratio} (0 or 1).
}
\description{
Identifies donor–recipient pairs where both have exchanged funding
(each organization acts as donor and recipient at least once).
}
\details{
Goal: Checks whether a donor and recipient have mutual funding roles
(both send and receive) — useful for consortia or pooled mechanisms.
}

donor_recipient <- indicator_donor_recipient_reciprocity(flows)

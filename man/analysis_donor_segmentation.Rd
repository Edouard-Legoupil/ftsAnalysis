\title{Donor Segmentation (Priority Matrix)}
\usage{
analysis_donor_segmentation(flows, recipient_name, top_n = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{Dataframe \code{flows}.}

\item{recipient_name}{Character name of our org (to compute "under-resourced" signals).}

\item{top_n}{number of observation on the plot}
}
\value{
a list with data, aka a Tibble with donor and assigned segment plus
Resource_Allocation_Score and a plot.
}
\description{
Classify donors into priority segments:
\itemize{
\item Strategic Stars (High priority, under-resourced)
\item Core Partners (High priority, well-resourced)
\item Emerging Opportunities (Medium priority, growth potential)
\item Maintenance Accounts (Low priority, stable)
\item Divestment Candidates (Low priority, declining)
}
}
\details{
Uses Engagement_Index, Alignment_Index, Growth_Potential computed from flows.
}
\examples{
result <- analysis_donor_segmentation(flows,
             recipient_name ="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees" )
print(result$plot)
}

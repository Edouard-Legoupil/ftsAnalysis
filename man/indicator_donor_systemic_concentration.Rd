\title{Donor Systemic: Concentration Index}
\usage{
indicator_donor_systemic_concentration(flows, donors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe including \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{donors}{(optional) A dataframe with donor names to merge with the
results.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{donor} and \code{Donor_Concentration_Index} (0–1 scale).
}
\description{
Calculates the Herfindahl–Hirschman concentration index (HHI) for each donor,
based on the distribution of funding amounts across recipient organizations.
A higher value means the donor funds fewer recipients more heavily.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures how concentrated a donor’s portfolio is across recipients.

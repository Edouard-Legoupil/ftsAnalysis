\alias{indicator_destination_dependency}
\title{Destination-Focused: Dependency Index}
\usage{
indicator_destination_dependency(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe including \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe with destination names to
merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Dependency_Index}
(0–1, higher = more dependent).
}
\description{
Calculates the share of a destination's total funding that comes
from its single largest donor.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures reliance on the top donor — i.e., the share of total funding
coming from the largest donor.

\title{Destination-Focused: Modality Balance}
\usage{
indicator_destination_modality_balance(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe including \code{destinationObjects}, \code{method},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe with destination names
to merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Modality_Balance}
(0–1 share of CTP).
}
\description{
Calculates the share of cash or voucher-based programming (CTP)
relative to all modalities within each destination.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures the balance between cash-based programming and traditional
modalities, based on the method variable.
}

destination <- indicator_destination_modality_balance(flows)

\usage{
indicator_destination_pipeline_visibility(
  flows,
  current_year = as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y")),
  destinations = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{destinationObjects}, \code{budgetYear},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{current_year}{Numeric, the current calendar year.}

\item{destinations}{Optional dataframe to merge.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Pipeline_Visibility}.
}
\description{
Measures the proportion of funding flows per destination that extend beyond
the current year.
}

destination <- indicator_destination_pipeline_visibility(flows)

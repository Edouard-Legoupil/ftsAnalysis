\title{Earmarking Flexibility}
\usage{
indicator_destination_earmarking_flexibility(flows, destinations = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{destinationObjects}, \code{amountUSD},
and \code{grandBargainEarmarkingType}.}

\item{destinations}{Optional dataframe to merge.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Earmarking_Flexibility}.
}
\description{
Computes a weighted average earmarking flexibility index per destination
(Unearmarked = 1.0, Softly earmarked = 0.75, Earmarked = 0.5, Tightly earmarked = 0.25).
}

destination <- indicator_destination_earmarking_flexibility(flows)

\title{Donor Timing Consistency Index}
\usage{
indicator_donor_timing_consistency(flows, donors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe containing \code{sourceObjects}, \code{budgetMonth} (1–12),
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{donors}{Optional dataframe with donor names.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{donor} and \code{Timing_Consistency}
(1 = very consistent, 0 = erratic).
}
\description{
This indicator measures how consistently a donor provides funding across
the months of the year, based on the transaction-level \code{date} field of
FTS flows. It evaluates the dispersion of monthly funding shares and scales
the result to a 0–1 index where higher values represent more regular and
predictable timing of contributions.

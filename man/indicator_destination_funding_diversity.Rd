\title{Destination-Focused: Funding Diversity Index}
\usage{
indicator_destination_funding_diversity(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe including \code{sourceObjects}, \code{destinationObjects},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe with destination names to
merge results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Funding_Diversity } (0–1 scale).
}
\description{
Measures how diversified each destination's funding base is across donors
using Shannon entropy of \code{amountUSD} distribution.
}
\details{
Goal: Measures how many donors contribute to each destination
— higher = more diverse and resilient funding base.
}

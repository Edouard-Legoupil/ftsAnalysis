\title{FTS Humanitarian Funding Flows Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 22441 rows and 29 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{character Unique identifier for each funding flow record, used for tracking updates and modifications to the same funding entry over time}
\item{\code{amountUSD}}{integer Total funding amount in US dollars, representing the standardized value for cross-donor comparison}
\item{\code{fullParkedAmountUSD}}{integer Complete parked amount in US dollars for flows that are temporarily held without specific allocation}
\item{\code{budgetYear}}{character Calendar year (January-December) in which the funding is planned to be utilized, following FTS's calendar year system}
\item{\code{childFlowIds}}{list List of downstream funding flow identifiers representing cascaded funding through implementation chains; child flows receive allocations from parent flows}
\item{\code{contributionType}}{character Type of humanitarian contribution: "financial" for monetary transfers or "in-kind" for goods and services}
\item{\code{createdAt}}{character Timestamp indicating when the funding flow record was initially created in the FTS database}
\item{\code{date}}{character Date when the funding information was submitted to FTS by the reporting organization}
\item{\code{decisionDate}}{character Date of grant agreement signing between donor and recipient, or official endorsement by donor member state - marks the commitment point}
\item{\code{description}}{character Detailed description of the funded activity/project, including location context, intervention details, and implementation timeframe}
\item{\code{grandBargainEarmarkingType}}{list Classification of funding flexibility according to Grand Bargain categories: Unearmarked (A-C), Softly earmarked (D-F), Earmarked (G-H), Tightly earmarked (I-L)}
\item{\code{exchangeRate}}{double Currency conversion rate applied to transform original amount to USD; uses UN Operational Exchange Rate if not specified}
\item{\code{firstReportedDate}}{character Initial date when the funding flow was first reported to FTS, used for tracking reporting history}
\item{\code{flowType}}{character Classification of flow structure: "Carryover" (previous year funds), "Parked" (temporarily unallocated), "Pass through" (cascaded funding), "Standard" (direct allocation)}
\item{\code{keywords}}{list Thematic tags and categorical labels associated with the funding flow for search and analysis purposes}
\item{\code{newMoney}}{logical Indicator of whether the funding represents new resources (TRUE) versus reallocated or reprofiled existing funds (FALSE)}
\item{\code{originalAmount}}{double Funding amount in the original currency before conversion to USD}
\item{\code{originalCurrency}}{character Currency in which the funding was originally provided or committed}
\item{\code{method}}{character Modality of assistance delivery: "Cash Transfer Programming (CTP)" (cash, mobile, vouchers) or "Traditional" (in-kind goods/services)}
\item{\code{parentFlowId}}{integer Identifier of the upstream funding flow from which this flow originates; used to trace funding through implementation chains}
\item{\code{status}}{character Funding lifecycle stage: "pledge" (non-binding intent), "commitment" (binding agreement), "paid" (disbursed funds)}
\item{\code{updatedAt}}{character Timestamp of the most recent modification to the funding flow record}
\item{\code{versionId}}{integer Version number tracking sequential updates and revisions to the funding flow information}
\item{\code{sourceObjects}}{list Nested data structure containing donor/origin information with components: id (identifier), name (source name), type (Organization/Location/UsageYear - indicating funding source year)}
\item{\code{destinationObjects}}{list Nested data structure containing recipient/allocation information with components: id, name, type (Cluster/GlobalCluster/Location/Plan/UsageYear/Organization), behavior (single/shared breakdown), and organization metadata (types, subtypes, levels) for organizational recipients}
\item{\code{boundary}}{character Classification of flow direction relative to analysis boundaries: "incoming" (crossing inward), "internal" (within boundary), "outgoing" (crossing outward)}
\item{\code{onBoundary}}{character Additional specification of boundary relationship for complex flow categorization}
\item{\code{reportDetails}}{list Reporting metadata containing: sourceType (information origin), organization (reporting entity), reportChannel (submission method), date (reporting date)}
\item{\code{refCode}}{character Grant agreement or reference code used by donors and recipients for administrative tracking and reconciliation}

\description{
A comprehensive dataset of humanitarian funding flows from the UN OCHA Financial Tracking Service (FTS). Contains detailed records of funding contributions, allocations, and implementation chains across global humanitarian responses. The data captures the entire funding lifecycle from pledges to disbursements, including donor behaviors, recipient patterns, and strategic funding characteristics.

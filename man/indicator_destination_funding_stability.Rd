\title{Destination-Focused: Funding Stability Index}
\usage{
indicator_destination_funding_stability(flows, destinations_df = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{A dataframe with \code{destinationObjects}, \code{budgetYear},
and \code{amountUSD}.}

\item{destinations_df}{(optional) A dataframe of destinations to merge
results with.}
}
\value{
A tibble with \code{destination} and \code{Destination_Funding_Stability_Index}.
}
\description{
Measures how stable funding amounts are for each destination over time.
Computed as 1 - coefficient of variation of annual funding.
Goal: Captures predictability of funding amounts over years (inverse of
coefficient of variation).
}
\examples{
destination <- indicator_destination_funding_stability(flows)

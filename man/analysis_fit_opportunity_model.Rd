\title{Fit a simple Funding Opportunity Model (logistic)}
\usage{
analysis_fit_opportunity_model(features, min_year = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{Dataframe produced by \code{analysis_prepare_opportunity_dataset()}.}

\item{min_year}{Minimum year to use for training (filters older data).}
}
\value{

\description{
Fits a logistic regression to predict whether a donor will fund a recipient

}
\details{
Label construction: response = 1 if total_amount > 0 in year t+1 for
same donor-recipient.
}
\examples{
features <- analysis_prepare_opportunity_dataset(flows)$data
model_results <- analysis_fit_opportunity_model(features , min_year = NULL)
print(model_results$plot)

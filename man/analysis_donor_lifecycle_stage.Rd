\title{Donor Lifecycle Stage Scoring}
\usage{
analysis_donor_lifecycle_stage(
  flows,
  alignment_df = NULL,
  recipient_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{flows}{Dataframe \code{flows}.}

\item{alignment_df}{Optional tibble with donor alignment scores (donor, alignment_score 0-1).}

\item{recipient_name}{Character: The name of the recipient organization to filter the flows by.}
}
\value{
Tibble with donor, metrics and stage (factor).
}
\description{
Assigns donors to lifecycle stages:
\enumerate{
\item Prospect (alignment > 0.7, no funding)
\item New Partner (1-2 years funding)
\item Growing Partner (increasing amounts, multiple sectors)
\item Strategic Partner (multi-year, flexible funding)
\item Legacy Partner (10+ years, co-design initiatives)
}
}
\details{
Uses flows to compute engagement_frequency, funding_trend (slope), multiyear_share proxy, and partnership_complexity proxy,
scoped to a specific recipient organization.
}

recipient_name <- "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"
stages <- analysis_donor_lifecycle_stage(flows, recipient_name= recipient_name )

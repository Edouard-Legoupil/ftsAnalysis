FTS focuses on humanitarian funding flows that is provided internationally. The exception is in-country provision of funds (whether from private or governmental sources) for projects in an appeal launched by an international organisation or organisations. 

Data does not include:

 *  a government's expenditure on crises within its own borders (except the in-country provision of funds whether from private or government sources, for projects in a response plan or appeal launched by an international organization)
 *  a government's expenditure on refugees within its own borders
 *  development data (except where funding has been reported for projects in an inter-agency response plan or appeal)
 *  concessional finance and soft loans
 *  remittances.

# fetch_fts_data

Below is a description of the type of variables on `flows` data -

## Identifiers

 * `id` the unique identifier for this row, to be used in the future when there is an update on the same funding for this row.

 * `versionId` 
 
 * `childFlowIds` The FTS database allows funding flows to be linked together to represent funding cascading through the implementation chain from primary donors to field implementers. When flows are chained together in this way, any flow downstream of the flow being viewed is referred to as a child flow. All child flows have a parent flow upstream. 
 
 * `parentFlowId` The FTS database allows funding flows to be linked together to represent funding cascading through the implementation chain from primary donors to field implementers. When flows are chained together in this way, any flow upstream of the flow being viewed is referred to as the parent flow. All parent flows have one or more child flows downstream. 
 
 * `flowType` factor with the following levels "Carryover"    "Parked"       "Pass through" "Standard" 
 
    *  A `parked` flow refers to a funding flow that initially may not be allocated to specific organizations or sectors, but for which additional information is forthcoming. ‘Parked’ funding is usually a parent flow (see glossary for parent flow) with a number of linked child flows. Parking a parent flow allows the children to reflect the source information from the linked parent. Parked records are either major funding decisions (e.g. ECHO decisions that begin as a large funding envelope without destination organizations) where the information on recipients is determined at a later time (and added as child flows), or multi-year funding records where yearly contributions are broken down as child flows of the 'parked' flow. 
        
    *  `Pass through` funding refers to downstream funding allocations (e.g. Donor to UN Agency to NGO, Donor to International NGO to Local NGO, etc.). 

 *  `refCode`   a code related to the grant agreement of the fund, ideally known by the donor and by the recipient organizations. 

 *  `reportDetails` list of the following variables   
        `sourceType`
        `organization`
        `reportChannel`
        `date`  
 
 
## Flow Description  
 
 * `description` the description briefly; ie. about the destination activity/project, location within the country, and duration.
 
 *  `grandBargainEarmarkingType` modality of earmarking (Earmarked, Softly earmarked, tightly earmarked, unearmarked)   https://fts.unocha.org/glossary
 
    __Unearmarked__ 
    *  A 	Fully flexible core contribution 	Financial contribution to the aid organisation budget, fully flexible (within the boundaries set in mandates, governing body regulations etc.) 	 
    *  B 	Fully flexible core contribution to the CERF 	Financial contribution to CERF budget, fully flexible within the CERF regulations. 	 
    *  C 	Core contribution 	Financial contribution to a significant part of the aid organisation’s mandate, e.g. restricted to the humanitarian operations of a double-mandated organisation. 	The aid organisation can be instructed to distribute at its discretion – on several strategic objectives/regions/crises to avoid the entire contribution being used in one context. 
    
    __Softly earmarked__ 	
    *  D 	Core contribution with limitations 	Financial contribution, but with exclusions pertaining to a small number of specific countries. 	The aid organisation can be instructed to only use funding outside of certain areas or countries. 
    *  E 	Directed to a geographical region or a strategic objective 	Financial contribution, fully flexible within the boundaries of the strategic objective (e.g. health or education) or region (e.g. Africa). 	Should reflect priorities in the Strategic Plan approved by the relevant governing body. 
    *  F 	Directed to a Country-Based Pooled Fund 	Financial contribution directed to a specific Country-Based Pooled Fund, otherwise fully flexible. 	 
    
    __Earmarked__ 	
    *  G 	Directed to an aid organiastion’s country operations 	Financial contribution, directed to a specific country, otherwise fully flexible. 	Should reflect priorities set by the relevant governing body regarding country operations. 
    *  H 	Directed to subobjective/target 	Financial contribution, directed to subcategories of strategic objectives, e.g. health/malaria or education /teacher training, but without geographical limitations. 	Should reflect priorities in the Strategic Plan approved by the relevant governing body. 
    
    __Tightly earmarked__ 	
    *  I 	Directed to a specific project 	Financial contribution directed to a specific project in a specific country. 	 
    *  J 	Directed geographically and thematically, tied financial 	Financial contribution, tied to certain conditions in terms of purchase restrictions, directed to a specific country/region and to a specific objective. For instance, financial contribution for purchase of ABC for school feeding in X-land. 	 
    *  K 	Directed geographically and thematically, in kind. 	In-kind contribution directed to a specific country/region and to a specific objective. For instance, rice for school feeding in X-land. 	 
    *  L 	Donor-initiated projects/directed contributions 	Financial contribution coupled with the demand for a specific project in a specific country fulfilling donor priorities. 	Not reflecting Strategic Plan of the aid organisation. For instance, it becomes a service provider. This will also put strain on non-project support costs (overhead costs). 
 
 * `contributionType` - (financial, in-kind) 
 
 * `Reporting Status` indicate the status of the humanitarian fund reported per each row ("New Contribution", "Top-up/Update", "Old Contribution") 
    *       New contribution (aka New money): The fund is being reported to FTS by the same reporter for the first time. 
    *      Top-up/update: The fund was reported to FTS by the same reporter and now there is an update on the amount and/or on any other details.
    *      Old contribution: The fund was reported to FTS by the same reporter and there is no change. Used when reporters share cumulative reports.
    
 *  `newMoney`  FALSE/TRUE
 
 *  `keywords`  
 
 *  `method` Cash Transfer Programming (CTP) 	refers to all programs where cash (or vouchers for goods or services) is directly provided to beneficiaries.The CTP can be of three types: cash, mobile phone transfer and vouchers. FTS refers to all other humanitarian assistance modalities as traditional aid. Traditional: Non-cash assistance provided in the form of materials or services (i.e. food, tents, PSS, secondment of staff).
 
 *  `boundary`  Boundaries classify relevant flows into the categories incoming, internal and outgoing.  The FTS database records flows of funding, and draws boundaries around (combinations of) flow properties to calculate totals. Examples of common boundaries are a response plan/appeal or a combination of a (donor or affected) country and a year. Drawing a boundary classifies the flows in the database into those crossing the boundary inward (incoming flows), those originating and terminating within the boundary (internal flows), those crossing it outwards (outgoing flows), and a fourth category that is not displayed  - those that are irrelevant to the boundary because they originate and terminate outside of it. Incoming flows are flows which cross a given search boundary inwards. If the boundary is e.g. an affected country and year, flows originating in donor countries or multilateral organisations attributed to the country are incoming flows, as is carry-over from a previous year.  To avoid double-counting, incoming flows should never be added to internal flows. Outgoing flows are flows which originate within and terminate outside a given search boundary. If the boundary is e.g. an affected country and year, flows representing carry-overs to the next year are outgoing flows. 
 
 * `onBoundary` 
 
 * `status` The status of humanitarian funding reported. (pledge, commitment, paid)
 
    *  "commitment" is for a binding agreement signed between parties OR for approval of a grant by the donor member state.  Creation of a contractual obligation regarding funding between the donor and appealing agency; almost always takes the form of a signed contract. This is the crucial stage of humanitarian funding: agencies cannot spend money and implement before a funding commitment is made.

    * "pledge" is for no binding agreement OR no official government approval.A non-binding announcement of an intended contribution or allocation by the donor. The recipient organization and response plan or project are not necessarily specified. As soon as a commitment is reported to FTS against a pledge, the amount in the pledge column is reduced accordingly. FTS tables therefore show the 'outstanding' (not 'total original') pledge amount. The information is reported to us directly by donors and agencies and may or may not include verbal commitments made at pledging conferences.

    * "paid" is for the money transfer realized. FTS does not track disbursements / installments
 
## Quantity 
 
 * `amountUSD` Total Amount in US$
 * `fullParkedAmountUSD`
 *  `originalAmount`
 *  `originalCurrency` Original Currency	The currency of the humanitarian fund reported.
 *  `exchangeRate`  If blank, FTS will use the UN Operational Exchange Rate (https://treasury.un.org/operationalrates/OperationalRates.php), as of the grant decision date

# filter_flows_for_indicators

When analyzing funding flow data from FTS (Financial Tracking Service), we need  to apply pre-processing and filtering rules to compute donor-, recipient-, or destination-level indicators  .  

The FTS data model contains several elements—such as funding chains, boundaries, parent/child flows, and "parked" envelopes—that must be normalized prior to any aggregation. This enforces the official FTS logic to ensure indicators are computed without double-counting or misclassification of funding flows.

__1. Boundary Filtering__
Only __incoming__flows are retained. Incoming flows represent funding entering a boundary (e.g., affected country + year, appeal, donor-country-year). This is the standard FTS method for calculating donor contributions, and prevents contamination from:

* Internal flows (money moving within the boundary)
* Outgoing flows (money leaving the boundary)
* Irrelevant flows (fully outside the boundary)

Boundary filtering ensures that only flows relevant to the selected analytical scope enter the indicator dataset.

__2. Parent/Child Flow Deduplication__
FTS allows funding flows to be "chained" to represent cascading funding (donor -> agency -> partner). Parent flows are typically high-level envelopes; child flows represent operational allocations.

We need to:
* Identifies parents by the presence of one or more `childFlowIds`.
* Removes all parent flows from the dataset.

This prevents double-counting parent envelopes together with their child breakdowns and ensures only operational flows are used in indicator calculations.

__3. Removal of "Parked" Flows__
Flows with `flowType == "Parked"` represent undecided envelopes awaiting breakdown into child flows (e.g., large ECHO decisions or multi-year envelopes).

These should not be used for:
* donor funding totals
* donor–recipient relationships
* sector or geographic alignment indicators

We need to remove them entirely, relying instead on their child flows when available.

__4. Budget Year Normalization__

The `budgetYear` column is converted safely to numeric to support time-series indicators such as:
* funding trends
* relationship duration
* consistency indices

Non-numeric and malformed values are converted to `NA` with warnings suppressed.

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
